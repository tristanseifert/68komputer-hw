# CPU Board Logic Equations
Here are the GAL logic equations for the CPU board. Filenames map to component names in the rev 2 board/schematic as follows:

- U102: addr_decode.pld
- U305: m68k.pld

** TODO ** It remains to be seen whether most of these logic equations are actually correct; since galette doesn't do parenthesis for grouping of individual components it might all be wrong. Whoops

## Old stuff
The 68008-based design I [wrote about](https://blraaz.me/hardware/2019/11/01/68komputer-it-lives.html) and some other stuff has been moved to the `old` directory. Unfortunately, those designs were done using Cadsoft EAGLE, and I no longer have access to my license for it. There are likely hardware bugs I have no way of fixing. Yay!
